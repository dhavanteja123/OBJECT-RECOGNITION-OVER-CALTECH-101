# OBJECT-RECOGNITION-OVER-CALTECH-101
some knowledge of how certain objects may appear and an image of a scene possibly containing those objects, report which objects are present in the scene.
TECHNOLOGIES STACK  Machine learning, Flask,Tensor flow/keras.
Used convolution neural network
We are trying to develop a web application that recognises 101 distinct objects in images
Used caltech 101 dataset tensorflow/keras are used as tools Flask is used for framework.

Pictures of objects belonging to 101 categories. About 40 to 800 images per category. Most categories have about 50 images. Collected in September 2003 by Fei- Fei Li, Marco Andreetto, and Marc 'Aurelio Ranzato. The size of each image is roughly 300 x 200 pixels.  We have carefully clicked outlines of each object in these pictures, these are included under the 'Annotations.tar'. There is also a matlab script to view the annotaitons, 'show_annotations.m'.
ACCURACY
• Object recognition is refers to a collection of related tasks for identifying objects in digital photographs.
• Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks, or R- CNNs, are a family of techniques for addressing object localization and recognition tasks, designed for model performance.
• You Only Look Once, or YOLO, is a second family of techniques for object recognition designed for speed and real-time use.
•Strengths are internal attributes of the organization that are helpful to the achievement of the objective.  
•Weaknesses are internal attributes of the organization that are harmful to the achievement of the objective.  
•Opportunities are external conditions that are helpful to the achievement of the objective.  
•Threats are external conditions that are harmful to the achievement of the objective. 
ERROR ANALYSIS
• Uncertainty in feature locations
–It is important to analyze the sensitivity of each
algorithm with respect to uncertainty in the location of the image features.
• Case of Indexing
–Analyze how errors in the locations of the points
affects the invariants.
